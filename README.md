# Learning `matplotlib`

## About

A picture is worth a thousand words, and with Pythonâ€™s matplotlib library,
it fortunately takes far less than a thousand words of code to create a production-quality graphic.

However, matplotlib is also a massive library,
and getting a plot to look just right is often achieved through trial and error.
Using one-liners to generate basic plots in matplotlib is fairly simple,
but skillfully commanding the remaining 98% of the library can be daunting.
